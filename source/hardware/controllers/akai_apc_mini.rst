Mapping description
-------------------

-  The 64 pads are mapped directly to the 64 samplers available in the extended skins. If the skin has less samplers, the corresponding buttons will simply not work.
-  All buttons light up in yellow when a sample is loaded in the corresponding slot. 
-  When pressed and while playing, they will light up green.
-  When stopped, they will light in red.
-  The sliders below the buttons are mapped to the pregain control of the first two rows of samplers, that is:
   The first slider controls Samplers 1 and 9, the second slider 2 and 10 and so on until the last that controls 8 and 16.
-  The last slider on the corner is attached to the Master Gain.
-  The key "Stop all clips" will actually do that.
-  The left and right arrows just above the sliders are attached to Deck 1 and Deck 2 Play.
