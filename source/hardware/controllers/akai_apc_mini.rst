Mapping description
-------------------

-  The 64 pads are mapped directly to the 64 samplers available in the extended skins. If the skin has less samplers, the corresponding buttons will simply not work.
-  All buttons supports three light states, yellow, green and red

 **Yellow**
   A sample is loaded and ready to play, but still not played.

 **Green**
   The sample is playing right now.

 **Red**
   The sample has played and now is stopped.

-  The sliders below the buttons are mapped to the pregain control of the first two rows of samplers, that is:
   The first slider controls Samplers 1 and 9, the second slider 2 and 10 and so on until the last that controls 8 and 16.
-  The last slider on the corner is attached to the Master Gain.
-  The key "Stop all clips" will actually do that.
-  The left and right arrows just above the sliders are attached to Deck 1 and Deck 2 Play.
