The Reloop Terminal Mix 2 and Terminal Mix 4 use the same mapping in Mixxx.

.. versionadded:: 1.11

Sound hardware
--------------

| The Reloop Terminal Mix 2 and Terminal Mix 4 have integrated multichannel
  sound cards. Usually, the TerminalMix runs very well with USB power only. If
  you experience issues especially when powering both Master and Booth outputs
  at high levels you should use the additional power supply (6v/1.5A).
| The official manual from Reloop states not to operate the unit at temperatures
  below 5¬∞C/41¬∞F as it might damage A/D converters and other components.
  However, the audio output may already start crackling if the temperature drops
  below 10¬∞C.

| **Inputs**
| Both TerminalMix 2 & 4 have a microphone and a switchable line/phono input
  that can be routed into Mixxx. The Microphone jack is at the front side of the
  controller, the RCA line jacks are at the back next to the line/phono switch.
| For both inputs there is a gain knob and a switch on the controller‚Äôs front
  side that toggles between routing the signal to the computer (``SW``) or
  mixing it directly with the master output (``MST``).
| ``MST`` allows to play music from external sources without any software, for
  example while setting up Mixxx software. Switch to ``SW`` if you want to use
  the line signal for vinyl control or AUX input, or if you want to record the
  microphone input with Mixxx, broadcast it, or put on effects.

| **Outputs**
| At the front, there are two headphone jacks (1/8" and 1/4‚Äú), both affected by
  the hard-wired ``TONE`` knob.
  At the back, there are unbalanced outputs for booth and master (RCA), as well
  as a balanced master output (1/4‚Äù).
| The output level of both master outputs, booth and headphone outputs are all
  controlled by respective hard-wired knobs in the center column which can‚Äôt be
  mapped to software.

Controller hardware / Maintenance
---------------------------------

| The jog wheels‚Äô touch sensitivity can be adjusted separately. Refer to the
  `official
  manual <http://www.reloop.com/media/custom/upload/Reloop-TM4_Factory+JogReset.pdf>`__
  for instructions.
| When used in dusty environment for a while you might find the MIDI LED
  flickering although you didn‚Äôt touch any of the controls. This is mostly due
  to dust/fuzz particles in the ‚Äòcomb‚Äô at the jog wheels‚Äô underside that is
  distracting the IR light barriers that detect platter movement. Remove the
  particles with a vacuum cleaner, or blow into the gap between wheel and
  housing.
| After a few years of heavy usage the pushbuttons and sliders may start to wear
  out. Then, buttons need to be pressed harder or in a different manner than
  what was working before, and sliders may send false values when they are
  actually in the ‚Äòoff zone‚Äô. Luckily, the pushbuttons are standard parts and
  relatively easy to replace, and the sliders‚Äô conductive surface can be cleaned
  with Q-tips and alcohol.

Mapping options
---------------

We have provided the following customization variables at the top of the script
you can set to your liking:

1. **pitchRanges**: Set the pitch slider range each time you toggle it.

Just open the ``controllers/Reloop Terminal Mix 2-4.js`` file in your favorite
text editor and you‚Äôll see these variables right near the top. Edit & save and
Mixxx will automatically reload the preset.

Deck controls
-------------

*The controls are the same on both sides of the controller. The left side
controls Deck 1 or 3 and the right side controls Deck 2 or 4.*

-  **Range** button - Toggles the pitch slider range. (See `Mapping
   Options <https://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/reloop_terminal_mix#mapping_options>`__)
-  **Keylock** button - Toggles key lock. [ToDo: map long-press to reset track
   key]

FX Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~

| This mapping uses the `Standard Effects
  Mapping <Standard%20Effects%20Mapping>`__ via components-js to control the FX
  units.
| Note: these knobs & buttons don‚Äôt switch to decks 3 and 4.

-  Press & hold: temporarily toggle an effect
-  focused effect: control the first three button parameters of the focused
   effect
-  **BEATS** encoder
-  Turn: adjust the Wet/Dry knob of the effect unit
-  Press repeatedly: adjust the BPM (not the pitch/speed!) of the loaded track
-  Shift & Press: move the nearest beat marker to the current play position

   when the Master volume clips in Mixxx
-  **POWER** LED (red)

Cross-fader section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Move the cross-fader to smoothly fade between the decks assigned to either side.

Deck assign switches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| *(Terminal Mix 4 only)*
| Use the four switches on the front of the unit to choose on which side of the
  cross fader that deck will be heard. (Note that the fader-start functionality
  correctly follows this assignment.) If ‚Äúthru‚Äù is selected, the cross-fader
  will not affect the audio from that deck and it will always be heard.

Curve adjust
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the knob to adjust the curve from a smooth fade to a fast cut.

*The remaining controls on the front of the unit adjust hardware parameters and
are not MIDI-mappable.*
