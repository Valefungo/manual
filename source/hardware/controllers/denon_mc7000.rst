Features
~~~~~~~~

-  4-channel DJ controller with digital mixer
-  Dual USB audio interfaces - connect 2 computers at once
-  16 velocity-sensitive performance pads
-  New dedicated key-matching and changing controls
-  Solid 6-inch touch-capacitive platters with tracking LED

Compatibility
-------------

-  **Mac** users should be just fine connecting the MC7000 and go.
-  **Windows** users need to install the Windows Driver from `Denon
   Download Site <https://www.denondj.com/downloads>`__.
-  **Linux** users need to know that the MC7000 internal audio interface
   is not available out-of-the-box for older Linux Kernels. You should
   upgrade your **Kernel** to minimum versions LTS: **4.19.105** or
   **5.4.21**, stable branch **5.6.x** or mainline **5.7.x** (valid at
   date 2020-04-28). Newer Kernels will also provide native audio
   support for this controller. Linux Kernel 5.3.x does not support that
   device and together with 5.5.x reached End-Of-Life.

   -  Linux Distributions built upon Ubuntu 18.04 and derivatives, like
      Linux Mint, KDE Neon etc. must update the Kernel to one of the
      mentioned above. As of July 2020 the Kernel 5.4.x is available
      from the Ubuntu 18.04 Update repo… Get latest upgrades with “sudo
      apt dist-upgrade”. Alternatively, there is a `Kernel update
      script <https://github.com/pimlie/ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh>`__
      available that helps fetching and installing different Linux
      Kernels from the Ubuntu Kernel PPA.
   -  Ubuntu 20.04 already comes with Kernel 5.4.x so it supports the
      MC7000 Audio Interface out-of-the-box. A fresh install is
      recommended but you can read further how to `upgrade Ubuntu 18.04
      to
      20.04 <https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-upgrading-ubuntu-desktop#1-before-you-start>`__.
   -  OpenSUSE Tumbleweed is currently on Kernel 5.6.x supporting the
      MC7000 Audio Interface.
   -  Manjaro Linux 19.0 and 20.0 feature Linux Kernel 5.4.x supporting
      the MC7000 Audio Interface.

Mapping
-------

This controller is made for Serato DJ and most of the mapping is made
for Mixxx accordingly. Anyhow, there are several differences for
functions not matching the Serato mapping. If you have any wishes to
improve the mapping, then please discuss it in the `Denon MC7000
Mapping <https://mixxx.discourse.group/t/denon-mc7000-mapping/18235>`__
thread.

    controlling the computer connected to USB Port 1 or USB Port 2. If
    only one USB Port is connected the controller activates this
    automatically.

3.  **Channel Level:** Turn this knob to adjust the level of the
    pre-fader, pre-EQ audio signal for the channel.

4.  **Channel Level Meters:** These LEDs display the audio signal level
    of the channel as in MIXXX GUI.

5.  **Channel EQ:** Turn these knobs to boost or cut the high,
    mid-range, and low frequencies for the channel.

6.  **Channel Filter:** Turn this knob to adjust the filter applied to
    the channel. Turn the knob counterclockwise to apply a low-pass
    filter. Turn the knob clockwise to apply a high-pass Filter.

7.  **Channel Cue:** Press this button to send the channel’s pre-fader
    signal to the headphones’ cue channel.

8.  **Channel Fader:** Use this fader to adjust the channel’s volume
    level.

9.  **Crossfader Assign:** Routes the audio playing on the corresponding
    channel to either side of the crossfader (L or R), or bypasses the
    crossfader and sends the audio directly to the program mix (center,
    Thru).

10. **Crossfader:** Use this crossfader to mix between the left and
    right decks.

11. **Channel FX:** Use these buttons to apply Effect A and/or B to the
    corresponding channel.

12. **Sampler Volume:** Turn this knob to adjust the volume level of the
    software’s sampler. If the volume is set to 0 then the Sampler banks
    are hidden, otherwise shown.

    the “talkover” feature, which automatically reduces the volume level
    of the master mix when you speak into the microphones. Press and
    hold Shift and then press this button to activate/deactivate the
    “post” feature. When on, the microphones’ signal will be sent to the
    Booth Outputs. When off, the microphones’ signal will not be routed
    to the Booth Outputs. **Right Deck:** Echo On/Off: Press this button
    to activate or deactivate the echo effect on the microphones’ audio
    signal.

20. **Phones Level:** Adjusts the volume of the headphones (hardware).

21. **Phones Mix:** Adjusts the software’s audio output to the
    headphones, mixing between the cue output and the master mix output
    (hardware).

22. **Split Cue:** When this switch is in the On position, the headphone
    audio will be “split” such that all channels sent to cue channel are
    summed to mono and sent to the left headphone channel and the master
    mix is summed to mono and sent to the right channel. When the switch
    is in the Off position, the cue channel and master mix will be
    “blended” together.

23. **Deck:** Selects which deck in the software is controlled by that
    hardware deck. The left deck can control Deck 1 or 3; the right deck
    can control Deck 2 or 4.

    deck. Press again to deactivate Sync. Hold this button down for one
    sec to permanently match the tempo.

26. **Cue / Track Start:** During playback, press this button to return
    the track to the cue point. If a cue point is not set yet, then
    press this button to set it at the current track position. If the
    deck is paused, press and hold this button to play the track from
    the cue point. Release the button to return the track to the cue
    point and pause it. To continue playback without returning to the
    cue point, press and hold this button and then press the Play
    button, afterwards release cue button. Press and hold Shift and then
    press this button to return to the start of the track.

27. **Play/Pause / Stutter:** This button pauses or resumes playback.
    Press and hold Shift and then press this button to “stutter-play”
    the track from the last set cue point.

28. **Platter:** This capacitive, touch-sensitive platter controls the
    audio playhead when the wheel is touched and moved. When the Vinyl
    button is on, move the platter to “scratch” the track as you would
    with a vinyl record. When the Vinyl button is off (or if you are
    touching only the side of the platter), move the platter to
    temporarily adjust the track’s speed.

29. **Stop Time:** Controls the rate at which the track slows to a
    complete stop (“brake time”) during backspin.

30. **Vinyl:** Press this button to activate/deactivate a “vinyl mode”
    for the platter. When activated, you can use the platter to
    “scratch” the track as you would with a vinyl record.

31. **Pitch Fader:** Move this fader to adjust the speed (pitch) of the
    track. You can adjust its total range with the Pitch Bend buttons.

   PAD button down. From first to 8th PAD button the loop size is set as
   1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4 and 8 beats. The SLIP function remains
   active so that the track continues at the position where it had been
   playing forward the whole time.
-  *This section needs further development.* **HELP APPRECIATED**

38. **Slicer / Slicer Loop:**

-  SLICER Mode is set as beatjump only (way different to Serato). The
   first row buttons jump forward by 1, 2, 4 and 8 beats. The 2nd row
   buttons jump backward by 1, 2, 4 and 8 beats.
-  *This section needs further development.* **HELP APPRECIATED**

39. **Sampler / Velocity Samp.:**

-  SAMPLER: 8 samplers can be triggered from either Deck. Add samplers
   to the sampler bank pushing a PAD button. If a sampler is loaded then
   the push will start the sampler, push again while playing will replay
   the track from start. Press and hold SHIFT and push a PAD button to
   stop a sampler while playing or eject a sampler when stopped.
-  *This section needs further development.* **HELP APPRECIATED**

40. **Auto-Loop/Reloop:** Press this button to create an auto-loop with
    the length of 4 beats. You may change the length of beats by using
    the 1/2 or X2 buttons. Press and hold Shift and then press this

43. **< / > Param 1/2:** These are currently used to beat jump backward
    or forward by 8 beats. Press and hold Shift and then press these
    buttons jumps 32 beats. *This section needs further development.*
    **HELP APPRECIATED**

44. **Slip:** Press this button to enable or disable Slip Mode. In Slip
    Mode, you can jump to cue points, trigger loop rolls, or use the
    platters, while the track’s timeline continues. In other words, when
    you stop the action, the track will resume normal playback from
    where it would have been if you had never done anything (i.e., as if
    the track had been playing forward the whole time).

45. **Censor / Rev:** Press this button to activate the Backspin
    feature. If the track did not stop yet then when you release the
    button, normal playback will resume. Press and hold Shift and then
    press this button to reverse the playback of the track. The original
    CENSOR function (as in Serato) can be manually triggered by

    through the tracks in your library. Press the left side button to
    load a track into the active Deck (1 or 3), press the right side
    button to load a track into the active Deck (2 or 4). Press and hold
    Shift and push the knob to open folders on the left side of the
    library.

49. **Sort:** *will be implemented with MIXXX 2.3*

50. **Back/Fwd/Sort BPM:** Press this button to move to the previous
    window. Press and hold Shift and then press this button to move to
    the next window. *MIXXX 2.3: Press and hold Sort and then press this
    button to sort the tracks by BPM.*

51. **Load Prep/Open Prep/Sort Key:** Press this button to load the
    currently selected track to the Preview Deck. Press and hold Shift
    and then press this button to start the track in Preview Deck.
    *MIXXX 2.3: Press and hold Sort and then press this button to sort
    the tracks by key.*

52. **Files/History/Sort Artist:** Press this to maximise the library.
    *MIXXX 2.3: Press and hold Sort and then press this button to sort
    the tracks by artist.*

53. **Panel/View/Sort Title:** Press this to open and close the FX
    section inside the GUI. *MIXXX 2.3: Press and hold Sort and then
    press this button to sort the tracks by title.*

54. **Needle Drop Strip:** The length of this strip represents the
    length of the entire track. Place your finger on a point along this
    sensor to jump to that point in the track. Press and hold Shift to
    jump to a position while a track is currently playing.

55. **FX On / Select:** Press this button to turn the corresponding
    effect on or off. Press and hold Shift and then press this button to
    select an effect from the list that was enabled in the MIXXX
    Properties FX section.

56. **FX Level:** Turn this knob to adjust the level of the
    corresponding effect. The FX On button under the knob must be lit
    for this knob to function.

57. **FX Beats:** Turn this knob to adjust the Wet/Dry rate of the
    effects.

58. **FX Tap:** Press this button will activate effects for the Master
    Signal instead of the individual Decks. Press and hold Shift and
    then press this button to have the effects also on the Headphone
    preview.

Front Panel. **Crossfader Contour:** Adjusts the slope of the crossfader
curve. Turn the knob to the left for a smooth fade (mixing) or to the
right for a sharp cut (scratching). The center position is a typical
setting. This seams to have a very minor effect in MIXXX.

LEDs
~~~~

The Channel Volume Meters matches to the ones shown in MIXXX GUI. Only
when clipping the red LED illuminates.

As mentioned before the Master Volume Meter is not correlated to MIXXX
GUI as the controller handles that in Hardware.

Button LEDs are fully mapped for the first function. As you press and
hold Shift then the secondary function has only got some mappings, e.g.
flashing TAP and KEY SYNC when activated.

Platter Ring LEDs are correlated with the VINYL button.

-  If VINYL Mode is set ON then the LED follows the 33.3 rpm value and
   is correlated with the platter movement too.
-  If VINYL Mode is set OFF the current track position is indicated by
   the Platter LEDs starting at the top.
