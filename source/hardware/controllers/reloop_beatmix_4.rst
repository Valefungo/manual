Audio
-----

This controller is a MIDI and audio class compliant device so it is compatible
as-is with Linux, MacOS and Windows. However, on windows, the manufacturer ship
an ASIO low-latency driver that can be found on the `Manufacturer’s product
page <http://www.reloop.com/reloop-beatmix-4>`__.

The MIC input is hardware-mixed and is not digitized so Mixxx can not have any
control on the mic and you can not use ducking in Mixxx.

The master volume and head volume knobs directly control hardware and don’t
change Mixxx controls. So be sure to adjust Mixxx controls to the desired level
using the mouse or keayboard.

well as preview tracks.

The trax selector has three modes:

-  **Track mode** (default): turning the trax selector will select tracks (one

   the “Back” button will switch to Playlist mode and pushing the trax selector
   will load the selected track into the preview deck, start playing and switch
   to Preview mode.
-  **Playlist mode**: turning the trax selector will select sidebar item (one by

   the trax selector will expand/collapse the selected sidebar item and pressing
   the “Back” button will return to Track mode.

   selector play/pause the preview deck and pushing the back button return to
   Track mode.

Transport Section
-----------------

**PLAY/PAUSE** Press to launch and pause your track.

**SHIFT + PLAY/PAUSE** This reverses the direction of the track playing.

**CUE** Cue sets a temporary CUE point. It is set by pausing the track and
pressing the CUE button. Whilst the track is playing, press CUE to return to
that point, where it will pause.

**SHIFT+ CUE** Takes you back to the start of your track.

**CUP** Pressing CUP takes you directly to your CUE point, starting playback
instantly. If no CUE point is set, it will jump to the beginning of the track.

**SHIFT + CUP** Changes the pitch range, cycling through 8%, 10%, 12% and 16%

**SYNC** Syncs the BPM and phase to that of the other track (if BPM is detected
on both).

**SHIFT + SYNC** Turn on master sync, keeping sync enabled

Jog wheel and pitch slider
--------------------------

Touch and move the jog wheel to scratch (either deck playing or not).

When playing, use the side of the wheel, without touching the metallic platter,
to temporarily bend the pitch (speed up/slow down playback).

When the deck is not playing, using the side of the wheel let you quick search
through your track.

Hold SHIFT and turn the jog wheel to quick search through your track

(shift ignores touch sensitive platter so holding shift and turning jogwheel is
the same as using the side of the jogwheel).

When a deck is playing, jog led will turn around at 33.3RPM. When track time
left is below 30 seconds, jog leds will blink slowly, and when track time
remaining is below 15 seconds, jog leds will blink quickly. These delays can be
changed by editing the two variables at the beginning of the JS file and
eventually set to -1 to disable jog led blink.

The pitch slider let you adjust pitch.

Pitch +/- buttons let you temporarily adjust the the speed one step
higher/lower. These buttons, when used with shift, let you `control
effects <#Effects-Section>`__.

different effect modes mapped:

-  Multi Effect mode (the default), where you can load up to three effects in
   each EffectUnit and control then with the superKnob

   control the first 6 parameters
